        The idea of project environment comes naturally when you set out to maintain
        computational reproducibility. And reproducibility is a must, I think, for any
        scientific publication. Yes, there are various degrees of reproducibility,
        however I find it beneficial to strive for the exact from the beginning and then,
        hopefully, get at least some, by the end.
    </p>
    <p>
        For projects that heavily rely on external (written by other people) software,
        computational reproducibility is <em>not</em> a trivial task, and should not
        be treated lightly. Here I will share a few lessons I learned and pitfalls
        I encountered during my last two years of running projects in bioinformatics.
    </p>
    <p>
        TL/DR:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use <tt><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/">pip-tools</a></tt> for Python</li>
        <li>Use <tt><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html">renv</a></tt> for R with settings <tt>snapshot.type="all"</tt>,
            <tt>use.cache=FALSE</tt></li>
        <li>Use version control and commit often</li>
        <li>Start all of this before you write your first line of code</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Background: Managing external code</h2>
    <p>
        It is great to write code and see it help you with analyses and your work.
        However, it's impossible to write all the code ourselves, and so we reuse code written
        by other people. We have less control over such code, and it's more challenging to
        keep it consistent with the project over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, modern programming languages come with package management software and
        infrascrtucture. Kind people make packages out of their useful code, put it online,
        where it is versioned, archived, and you can download it easily. Each <b>package</b> has
        a number of <b>versions</b>, and each version has <b>dependencies</b>: a list of
        other packages that are needed for this package to function, sometimes with version
        restrictions (e.g. version should be exactly "1.2" or newer than "3.4").
    </p>
    <p>
        The problems come with time: packages change, improve, get deprecated… Each new version
        of a package can change that part of the code that you use, can add new dependencies
        or remove old ones, and so with time the probability that your code will not give
        you the same results as it did increase, as does the probability that your code will
        stop working.
    </p>
    <p>
        The solution is to write down all the packages that your project uses, including
        recursive dependencies, along with their versions. Starting another project, you would
        write down a new list, that is independent from the first, because likely you
        will want to make changes to them separately. This is called a <b>virtual environment</b>
        (or project environment). In R a tool for virtual environments is
        <tt><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html">renv</a></tt>. In Python
        there is a built-in module
        <tt><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">venv</a></tt>.
    </p>
    <h2>Pitfalls with <tt>renv</tt></h2>
    <p>
        Problems with virtual environments do not become apparent right away. Only when couple
        of months have passed and you want to return to a project, you can discover that
        something isn't working as you expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn't realize that <tt>renv</tt> default behaviour, probably inherited from
        <tt>packrat</tt>, is to discover packages to write down by analyzing your code.
        This is controlled by the settings <tt>snapshot.type</tt> and I strongly recommend
        setting it to <tt>"all"</tt>. This will record every package that is installed in the
        current project.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had several common functions extracted into a separate shared repository. I&nbsp;included
        those files with <tt>source("https://github.com/…")</tt>, and <tt>renv</tt> didn't
        follow that to discover packages included from there. A few important packages didn't
        have their versions recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another nuance with <tt>renv</tt> is that it by default install packages into a common
        space (cache), from which it links them (symlink) to the projects. While it sounds
        good in theory, and does save time, I discovered that after some operations some of
        those symlinks get broken. I don't know what exactly triggers it, but <tt>renv</tt>
        isn't very gracious at restoring or reinstalling those missing packages.
    </p>
    <p>
        While this needs further investigation from me, I currently set to not use this common
        cache, and recommend the same to you. This is controlled by <tt>use.cache</tt> setting.
    </p>
    <h2>Pitfalls with <tt>pipenv</tt></h2>
    <p>
        Python's <tt>venv</tt> module only provides a separate space where you can install
        the project's packages. It doesn't, however, record installed packages along with their
        versions as <tt>renv</tt> does. People use different tools and approaches to record
        and keep track of packages and versions. Initially, I used
        <tt><a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">pipenv</a></tt> for that.
    </p>
    <p>
        After several months of working with the initial setup of the project's packages,
        I needed to add a new dependecy. It was very hard to convince <tt>pipenv</tt> to
        not update my other packages in the project. I tried several combinations of
        parameters to do that, and one of them resulted in an incompatible versions of
        packages being installed without any warning or issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        I encountered the same situation couple more times and switched to <tt>pip-tools</tt>,
        which has a policy of keeping all installed package versions intact by default.
        Several months have passed since then, and I haven't run into an issue with
        this tool yet.
