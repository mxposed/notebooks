### 1. Firefox always suggest outlook website as mailto application
If you, like me, are every time annoyed by Firefox suggesting to save Outlook website (or maybe some other website) as an mailto application handler, 
then in `about:config` you can switch the preference `network.protocol-handler.external.mailto` to `false`
